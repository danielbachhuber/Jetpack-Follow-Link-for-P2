== Description ==

Easily subscribe to a P2 comment thread without commenting using a "Follow" action link like WordPress.com has.

This plugin requires Jetpack and P2 to both be activated. It doesn't yet allow you to unfollow, and there are some minor interface quirks.

Happy to receive feedback, questions, feature suggestions, and [pull requests](https://github.com/danielbachhuber/Jetpack-Follow-Link-for-P2)

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this plugin is to go to Add New in the Plugins section of your blog admin and search for "Jetpack Follow Link for P2." On the far right side of the search results, click "Install."

You'll need to be running Jetpack and the P2 theme for any interface elements to appear.

If the automatic process above fails, follow these simple steps to do a manual install:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy the merits of easy comment subscriptions in your P2!
